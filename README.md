# MyReads React Project

This project demonstrates ability in using React to create a single page application that uses React Router. With this app you can search through a backend database of books and add those books to different bookshelves, read, want to read, or currently reading. The bookshelves are displayed with the current list of books on them, and the books can then be changed to different shelves.

## How to start the app

* clone this repository or download this zip file
* Install Node.js if it is not already installed
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* go to localhost:3000 in your web browser to be on the home screen

## How to use the application

To use this application, navigate to the search page and enter a search term to find books. The search is limited to a fixed set of terms that are outlined below. Select a book that is returned from the search and indicate which shelf you would like to place that book on. On the bookshelf screen, view all of you books that are currently on shelves and switch shelves by selecting a book and changing it's shelf to one of the options.
